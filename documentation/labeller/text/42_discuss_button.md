# Discuss Button

The "Discuss" button can be used to mark tweets that need to be discussed during one of the weekly labeling meetings, see figure \ref{fig:discuss}. Once a tweet is marked for discussion, it will not be shown to other users until it has been reviewed. Use this button for tweets where there is significant uncertainty about which labels are appropriate.
