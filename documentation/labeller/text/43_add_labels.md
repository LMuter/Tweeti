# Adding Labels

Labels can be added in two ways: through the menu or via a shortcut key. In both cases, the label is immediately saved to the server, and the user's ID is included in the process so that changes can be undone if necessary.

The label buttons can either directly add a label or open a menu to allow hierarchical labelling (this structure can be set via de admin view).

When the user click a menu button, a menu of labels will appear, as shown in figure \ref{fig:menu}. The user can now click on a label from the manu or press a shortcut key (shown in red) to add the related label (e.g. press the M-button to include the mainstream Media label

When a label is added, a tag is show above the label buttons containing the label name, as shown in figure \ref{fig:labelsuser}. The color of a tag (to group labels) can be set within the admin view.
