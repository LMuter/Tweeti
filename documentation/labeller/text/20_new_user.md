# New User

New labelers can only be added by an admin. To create a new user, a username, email address, and password are required. The password is pre-set so that the new user can log in immediately. The first task for a new user is to change their pre-set password.


## Logging In

To log in, click the login button in the top right corner of the screen.


## Changing Password

After logging in, you can change your password by clicking "Update Password" in the top right corner.


## Email Notifications

Please note that the update link sent via email (from tweeti@gmail.com) might end up in your spam folder.
