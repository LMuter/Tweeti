Previously, labeling tweets was done using an Excel script. This was not an effective solution because labelers couldn't view each other's labeled tweets, working with Excel was demotivating, and it introduced unnecessary extra steps. For these reasons, the Tweeti (Twitter Intelligence) tool was developed. Tweeti simplifies the labeling process and allows users to click through to the original tweet on Twitter. Additionally, it enables users to view the work of others and access their own statistics. The primary goal of Tweeti is to minimize overhead, allowing the next tweet to be labeled within a few milliseconds.

Tweeti can be accessed through Firefox and Chrome and is available within the police network.

Tweets are always displayed in the center of the screen. Below each tweet, you'll find the label categories, as well as the buttons: "Previous Tweet," "Next Tweet," "Exclude Tweet," and "Discuss Tweet."

Labeling consists of several steps: The first step is to read the tweet and optionally select descriptive words or phrases. The second step is to assign labels, where the selected text is related to the chosen label. Finally, you can click the "Next Tweet" button to continue the process. Note that there is no "Save" button; all changes are saved automatically. It is not possible to skip labeling a tweet.

Tweets can be labeled using the Tweeti labeling tool, available at http://tweeti.pythonanywhere.com/. Below is an overview of all the functions.
