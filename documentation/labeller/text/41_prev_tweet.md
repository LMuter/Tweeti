# Previous Tweet


This button allows you to go back through the history of labeled tweets (see figure \ref{fig:prev}), with the following considerations:

- The "Previous Tweet" button does not go back further than the last browser refresh. If the browser is closed, the history of previous tweets is lost.
- The labels of previous tweets are displayed as they were originally entered by the user. If another user has made changes to the labels, those changes will not be reflected.

> **NOTE**
>
> - When you click the "Previous" button, the tweet will automatically be marked with "No Label" even if it already has existing labels.
> - If a tweet has been excluded, it will still appear in the history and will also receive the "No Label" label.
