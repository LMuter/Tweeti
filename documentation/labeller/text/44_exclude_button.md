# Exclude Button

The "Exclude" button can be used to remove tweets from the dataset (see figure \ref{fig:exclude}). Use this button to indicate that a tweet is written in a different language or is clearly about a different subject than the incident being labeled. When using the "Exclude Tweet" button, a confirmation prompt will appear to prevent mistakes.
