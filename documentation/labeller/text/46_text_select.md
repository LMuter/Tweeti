# Selecting Text

Before adding a label, the selected text will be captured and linked to the label. When you hover over a label with selected text, that selected text will become visible again.

> **NOTE**
>
> Currently, all occurrences of the selected words are highlighted, but in the backend, only the specific selected text is stored.

This feature allows you to associate a specific part of the tweet with a label. If you want to add multiple labels, after selecting the text and applying the first label, you should deselect the text before adding the next label. This way, the text won't be linked to the subsequent label. Alternatively, you can choose to select different text for the next label.
