  abstract  = "Black Lives Matter, like many modern movements in the age of
               information, makes significant use of social media as well as
               public space to demand justice. In this article, we study the
               protests in response to the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by
               police in Charlotte, North Carolina, on September 2016. Our goal
               is to measure the significance of urban space within the virtual
               and physical network of protesters. Using a mixed-methods
               approach, we identify and study urban space and social media
               generated by these protests. We conducted interviews with
               protesters who were among the first to join the Keith Lamont
               Scott shooting demonstrations. From the interviews, we identify
               places that were significant in our interviewees' narratives.
               Using a combination of natural language processing and social
               network analysis, we analyze social media data related to the
               Charlotte protests retrieved from Twitter. We found that social
               media, local community, and public space work together to
               organize and motivate protests and that public events such as
               protests cause a discernible increase in social media activity.
               Finally, we find that there are two distinct communities who
               engage social media in different ways; one group involved with
               social media, local community and urban space, and a second
               group connected almost exclusively through social media.",

               movement, such as \#AllLivesMatter, and \#BlueLivesMatter. We
               introduce a data set of 63.9 million tweets from 13.0 million
