# User Management

Users can be managed through the admin page (which is automatically generated by Django) at `<your url>/admin` (e.g. `https://www.example.com/admin`). Under "AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION," click on "Users" to manage the users (see Figure \ref{fig:usersadmin}).

## Adding a User

Go to `<your url>/admin` (e.g. `https://www.example.com/admin`) and click on "Users" Then, click on "ADD USER" (the gray button in the top right corner), fill in the required information, and click "SAVE" (see Figure \ref{fig:adduser}).

After creating a user, you will be directed to a page where you can enter additional information. Under "Permissions" make sure the user is marked as "Active" and is a member of the "Labeller" group (see Figure \ref{fig:addrole}).

If you have configured an email client in Django's `settings.py`, Tweeti can also send emails to users (for example, to set or reset passwords). In that case, it is useful to enter the user's email address. Other details (such as first and last name) are optional.


## Granting a User Admin Rights

Once a user is created (see "Adding a User"), you can choose to grant them admin rights (making the user a "superuser"). When a user has admin rights, they can access the admin page and make changes (such as creating users, modifying labels, uploading documents, etc.).

To grant a user admin rights, select "Staff status" and "Superuser status" (you can also select all permissions, but this is not necessary), see Figure \ref{fig:userstatus}.
