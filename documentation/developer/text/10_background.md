# Background

Tweeti is a web-based tool designed to facilitate the labeling of short messages, such as posts (formerly known as tweets). It includes features like shortcuts to speed up the labeling process and can be used on multiple devices, including laptops, phones, and tablets.

There is a Code Ocean capsule created for this project, to see the development code in action, see https://codeocean.com/capsule/8199255/tree/v1.
