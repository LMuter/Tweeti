# Contribute to Tweeti

I'm happy you're reading this, since all developers who want to help are more than welcome to join!


## About Tweeti

Tweeti is an opensource project to label Tweets. I know there are already many labeling tools, but our aime is to build a tool that is light weight, easy to use and suitable for text analysis. You can find a life version of [Tweeti](https://www.tweeti.nl).


## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitLab Merge Request to the Tweeti project](https://gitlab.com/tweeti/tweeti_labeling/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (more about [merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/)). When you send a merge request, we will love you forever if you include pytest or Cucumber specs. Good test coverage is a good way to prevent time consuming errors. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."


Thanks,
Laurens MÃ¼ter
