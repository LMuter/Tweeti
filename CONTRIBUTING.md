## About Tweeti

Tweeti is an open-source project designed for labeling tweets. While there are already many labeling tools available, our aim is to build a tool that is lightweight, easy to use, and particularly suited for text analysis.


## Submitting changes

Please submit a [GitHub Pull Request to the Tweeti project](https://github.com/LMuter/Tweeti/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (more about [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)). When you submit a pull request, we would greatly appreciate it if you include pytest or Cucumber specs. Good test coverage is essential for preventing time-consuming errors. Please follow our coding conventions (outlined below) and ensure all your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear commit message. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but for bigger changes, your commit message should look like this:


```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```


Thanks,

Laurens MÃ¼ter
